Synth that generates square, triangle, sawtooth, and sine waves. 
Type on the keyboard to play a note. 
Press spacebar to change the waveform.
Use the left and right arrow keys to change the octave.
Click the three-dot-stack-symbol to activate the arpeggiator.
The arpeggiator cycles between a maximum of three notes.
Use the up and down arrow keys to change the speed of the arpeggiator.
The Javascript library I'm using, tones.js, takes advantage of the Web Audio API to synthesize tones in different waveforms.
